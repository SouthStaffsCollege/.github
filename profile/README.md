# Github @ South Staffordshire College.

This Org Primarily serves to provide SSO access to our Students, and shouldn't be treated as a formal point of contact - please go to our main website (https://www.southstaffs.ac.uk/) and contact us if you need to.

For Students (Or Staff) who've ended up here by accident, you probably want the logon page instead - go to https://github.com/orgs/SouthStaffsCollege/sso for that.
